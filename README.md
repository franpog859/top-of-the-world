# Proof that your country is the TOP OF THE WORLD!

I just wanted to proof that your country is the top of the world. Do you know that the highest point of the Earth is Mount Everest? Yeah, you probably already know that. But did you know that the farthest point from the center of the Earth is NOT Mount Everest? It's Chimborazo in the Andes! And it's more than two kilometers lower than Mount Everest.

How is is possible? Earth's surface is not a perfect sphere. It's more like a football when you sit on it. Poles ale actually closer to the center of the Earth than some equator places.

Okay! But how that will make your country the top? See, there are already at least two definitions of the top of the world. Let's see my definition! If someone stands at some point of the Earth and all of other points are literally below them it makes this point the top. It seems like the easiest top definition you can imagine.

My computer cannot handle higher resolution (it already took about an hour to compute). It seems that the Earth is much rounder than spiky. I mean almost all the land here could be interpreted as the top of the world. Let's dig deeper!

We can see some mountains here and their shadows. If there is some point near the mountain it cannot be the top. The mountain (or the land on the other side) is always higher.
